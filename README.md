First of all, please note that I am currently studying. Therefore, as I don't have so much free time, I'm not usually available on GitHub or any social network. So it may take me a while to answer messages or to contribute to a project. Thanks for your understanding and sorry for the inconvenience. As soon as I finish my pending studies, I will be able to dedicate more time to open source projects.
