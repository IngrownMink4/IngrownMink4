# IngrownMink4
Hi! I'm Sergio and [I'm a 22 years old boy](https://en.pronouns.page/@IngrownMink4) who loves Free/Libre and Open Source Software. You can chat with me through **[Telegram](https://t.me/IngrownMink4)** or you can **[send me an e-mail](mailto:sergiovg01@outlook.com)**.


*First of all, please note that I am currently **working full time in an establishment**. Therefore, as I don't have so much free time, I'm not usually available on GitHub or any social network. So it may take me a while to answer messages or to contribute to a project. Thanks for your understanding and sorry for the inconvenience. At the moment, I only plan to contribute to those projects in which I am already involved. I won't be involved in any more for a long time. As soon as I finish my pending studies, I will be able to dedicate more time to open source projects.*
