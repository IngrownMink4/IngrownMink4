# IngrownMink4
Hi! I'm IngrownMink4 and I'm a [20 years old boy](https://pronoun.is/he) who loves Free/Libre and Open Source Software. You can chat with me through **[Telegram](https://t.me/IngrownMink4)** or you can **[send me an e-mail](mailto:sergiovg01@outlook.com)**.


*First of all, please note that I am currently studying. Therefore, as I don't have so much free time, I'm not usually available on GitHub or any social network. So it may take me a while to answer messages or to contribute to a project. Thanks for your understanding and sorry for the inconvenience. As soon as I finish my pending studies, I will be able to dedicate more time to open source projects.*
